This tool allows you connect to the server and upload you're update for the patcher. It creates the MD5 hash of the file. And upload's it. There's also a SIMPLE KEY_CHECK for "logging". I made it for testing purposes, you can improve it..

Needed python libraries> PyQt5, hashlib, and requests.

PyQt5 used for easy UI creation.

You can improve it, I accept pull requests.
